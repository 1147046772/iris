### Should I upgrade my Iris?

Developers are not forced to upgrade if they don't really need it. Upgrade whenever you feel ready.

> Iris uses the [vendor directory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo) feature, so you get truly reproducible builds, as this method guards against upstream renames and deletes.

**How to upgrade**: Open your command-line and execute this command: `go get -u github.com/kataras/iris` or let the automatic updater do that for you.

TODO:

1. add one more feature, to 'get' auto-created *Route on the mvc by the function name, people need this to change the route's name
for reverse routing in the templates, I've already implemented the 'add custom routes' based on any mvc function by its name.

2. list of the changes, we have just one big change,
on the mvc re-design but we have some improvements as well
I will not list all 70 commits ofc, just the actual changes
the end-developer should know. -->
