## Hardware

* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) **i7-4710HQ** CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.50GHz
* RAM: **8.00 GB**

## Software

* OS: Microsoft **Windows** [Version **10**.0.15063], power plan is "High performance"
* HTTP Benchmark Tool: https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier, latest version **1.1**
* **.NET Core**: https://www.microsoft.com/net/core, latest version **2.0**
* **Iris**: https://github.com/kataras/iris, latest version **8.3** built with [go1.8.3](https://golang.org)

## Results

We will compare two identical things here, in terms of application, the expected response and the stability of their run times, so we will not try to put more things in the game like `JSON` or `XML` encoders and decoders, just a simple text message. To achieve a fair comparison we will use the MVC architecture pattern on both sides, Go and .NET Core.

#### Summary

* Time to complete the `5000000 requests` - smaller is better.
* Reqs/sec - bigger is better.
* Latency - smaller is better
* Throughput - bigger is better.
* Memory usage - smaller is better.
* LOC (Lines Of Code) - smaller is better.

.NET Core MVC Application, written using 86 lines of code, ran for **2 minutes and 3 seconds** serving **40226.03** requests per second within **3.09ms** latency in average and **169.12ms** max, the memory usage of all these was ~123MB (without the dotnet host).

Iris MVC Application, written using 27 lines of code, ran for **47 seconds** serving **105643.71** requests per second within **1.18ms** latency in average and **22.01ms** max, the memory usage of all these was ~12MB.

Iris Application, written using 22 lines of code, ran for **45 seconds** serving **110809.98** requests per second within **1.13ms** latency in average and **18.02ms** max, the memory usage of all these was ~11MB.

#### Update: 20 August 2017

As [Josh Clark](https://twitter.com/clarkis117) and [Scott Hanselman‏](https://twitter.com/shanselman)‏ pointed out [on this status](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/899005786826788865), on .NET Core MVC `Startup.cs` file the line with `services.AddMvc();` can be replaced with `services.AddMvcCore();`. I followed their helpful instructions and re-run the benchmarks. The article now contains the latest benchmark output for the .NET Core application with the change both Josh and Scott noted.

The twitter conversion: https://twitter.com/MakisMaropoulos/status/899113215895982080

For those who want to compare with the standard services.AddMvc(); you can see the old output by pressing [here](screens/5m_requests_netcore-mvc.png).

## Results with Templates

Let’s run one more benchmark, spawn `1000000 requests` but this time we expect HTML generated by templates via the view engine.

### .NET Core MVC with Templates

#### Summary

* Time to complete the `1000000 requests` - smaller is better.
* Reqs/sec - bigger is better.
* Latency - smaller is better
* Memory usage - smaller is better.
* Throughput - bigger is better.

.NET Core MVC with Templates Application ran for **1 minute and 20 seconds** serving **11738.60** requests per second with **89.03MB/s** within **10.10ms** latency in average and **1.97s** max, the memory usage of all these was ~193MB (without the dotnet host).

Iris MVC with Templates Application ran for **37 seconds** serving **26656.76** requests per second with **192.51MB/s** within **1.18ms** latency in average and **22.52ms** max, the memory usage of all these was ~17MB.

**Thank you all** for the 100% green feedback, have fun!
