I can do one of the followings to this "di" folder when I finish the cleanup and document it a bit,
although I'm sick I will try to finish it tomorrow.

End-users don't need this.
1) So, rename this to "internal".

I don't know if something similar exist in Go,
it's a dependency injection framework at the end, and a very fast one.

2) So I'm thinking to push it to a different repo,
  like https://github.com/kataras/di or even to my small common https://github.com/kataras/pkg collection.
